I had the opportunity to speak at Interop 2016 in Las Vegas with Cody Bunch, Principal Cloud Architect for Rackspace. We spoke about how to provide mentorship to new learners in a company, and I gave my perspective as a recent apprentice. I had a great time and can't wait until I present at my next conference!

This project was conceived by my residence friends and me. Users sign up for email notifications. A python script running bogosort, a particularly inefficient list sorting algorithm, runs on a web-server and sends an email to users when it completes (approximately every 45 days or so). This project was intended to be a way to help my friends learn about web development, and improve my own skills as well.

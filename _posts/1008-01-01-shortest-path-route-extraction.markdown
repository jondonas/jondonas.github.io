Digital Humanities class, 2018.

The idea of this project is to give people a glimpse of what it was like to navigate through Manhattan in the past, specifically in 1829, at a time when New York City was experiencing rapid growth. To accomplish this, we built a direction-finding tool which was inspired by Google Maps and similar services. This tool allows a user to find the shortest path between start and end points selected on a map. It also computes estimated travel times and takes into account both the layout of the city as it was at the time, and the modes of transportation available at the time.

This gives the interested user the chance to appreciate how navigation was different two centuries ago from what it is like now and to explore how both routes and travel times have evolved.

As an Undergrad Research Assistant at the University of Waterloo, I contributed to the early stage development of the Internet of Drones (IoD) project. IoD is a layered network control architecture designed for coordinating the access of unmanned aerial vehicles in controlled airspace. The end goal was to have a full framework that could be used to provide navigation services for many drones between locations. The first practical implementation was an autonomous mailing system on campus.
